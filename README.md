# RGBA-Eater
Image processing script used to convert 32bpp RGBA PNG images into 8 bpp Indexed PNG images used in OpenTTD.

This page is trying to be a comprehensive step by step tutorial and a complete documentation of the RGBA-Eater script. It aims to show how to install and use it.

# Installation (on Windows)

1. Python v3 is required. You can obtain it at https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. I believe Python needs to be added to System environment variables (you can select this option when installing Python, I think by default it is off)
3. Pillow (a Python module) is required. This should be possible to do by opening the Windows command line and writing a command `pip install pillow`

The RGBA Eater only needs to be unzipped or checked out into a folder of your choice.

# Basic usage

The script can be used in many interesting ways, but out of the box 

### Example.bat
* The converter can be launched from a command line, but it can be convenient to start with double-clicking the `example.bat` to run it.
* `-n` parameter is mandatory sets the 32bpp input image filename. The `/32bpp` sub-folder is currently mandatory.
* The outputs will automatically be placed into the `/8bpp` sub-folder.
* `-e` parameter sets which colour types to be used in the 8bpp output. The default `example-command.bat` uses `ALL`. This means all colours in the palette except company colours (CC1 and CC2) and animated colours.

# All parameters

RGBA-Eater can be customized a lot, but it also means there are many parameters to describe. They ones I consider the most useful are at the top of the following list.

* `-e` **--allowed_colour_types** - Set which colour types can show in the 8bpp output. Colour types are sets of colours using names I gave them. You can find the full list of possible names down below.
* `-f` **--allowed_colour_types** - Set which colour types can't show in the 8bpp output. Sometimes it can be convenient to allow ALL colour types and then subtract a few by this parameter.
* `-i` **--disallowed_colour_indexes** - Parameter to enable specific colour indexes. See the palette-key.png in /x-script-input folder to see which colour is which index.
* `-y` **--disallowed_colour_indexes** - Parameter to disable specific colour indexes. If a specific colour is showing in your converted result it can be handy to be able to get rid of it easily.

* `-a` **--alpha_ignore** - Pixels with semi-transparency must be ignored at threshold. This parameter sets the threshold. The default value is `128` which is 50% transparency.
* `-c` **--colour_shift** - When pixels are near the Alpha ignore threshold, their result colour gets darkened or brightened depending on the result. By default this behaviour is on, adding `-c` will turn it off.
* `-o` **--alpha_offset_1** - Defines the threshold when the Colour shift occurs by 1 colour index. Default value is `178`
* `-p` **--alpha_offset_2** - Defines the threshold when the Colour shift occurs by 2 colour indexes. Default value is `230`

* `-j` **--checker_alpha** - When given greater value than `0`, half the pixels are ignored in a checker grid. Useful to imitate transparent areas (see Tubular bridges in TTD graphics). Setting `1` means 1x1 pixel grid, `2` 2x2 pixel grid and so on.
* `-l` **--checker_alpha_pink** - When Checker alpha is enabled, the ignored pixels are given pink colour. Using for example `-i 215` is necessary to allow a pink index in the output. This can be useful for copying the results between/over 8bpp files.
* `-k` **--probability_alpha** - Less opaque pixels are ignored with a probability based on their transparency. Useful for 32bpp transparency gradients like shadows.

* `-t` **--thread_count** - Sets the amount of threads the converter can run on. With large images it can take a long time to process, so using multiple threads is useful then. By default it is currently `16`
* `-x` **--auto_clean_temp** - Results of individual threads are placed in `/x-script-temp` folder. Using `-x` makes the RGBA-Eater automatically remove these images after the conversion is finished, the final image combined and saved to `/8bpp`
* `-z` **--individual_temp** - In some cases it can be interesting if the temp folder uses more unique file names based on the input file namme. Using `-z` enables that.

* `-r` **--red_weight** - You can customize how much of each colour channel influences the result. The default value is `1`.
* `-g` **--green_weight** - You can customize how much of each colour channel influences the result. The default value is `1`.
* `-b` **--blue__weight** - You can customize how much of each colour channel influences the result. The default value is `1`.

* `-d` **--debug_level** - You can increase the debug level in order to see more detailed information about the process in the console. Probably only useful for debugging the code. Default value is `1`, maximum is `7`. Using higher values seems to slow the process down significantly as it spends a lot of time outputting into console.

# Colour types

There are many colour types that you can use in `-e` or `-f` parameters.

* `EVERYTHING` - every single colour index, including the weird ones you probably don't want
* `ALPHA_BLUE` - index 0, I don't expect this to be used often as that's already the result of transparency
* `ALL` - indexes 1-79, 88-196, 205-214 - all "normal" colours - no action colours, no company colours, no pure white (index 255) and no useless colours like pure alpha pink
* `GRAYSCALE` - indexes 1-15
*. `METAL` - indexes 16-23 - more bluey/metallic gray
* `LIME_GREEN` - indexes 24-31
* `BEIGE` - indexes 32-39
* `DARK_PINK` - indexes 40-47
* `YELLOW` - indexes 50-52 and 60-69 - yellow colours, including the 3 separate indexes 50-52
* `DARK_BEIGE` - indexes 53-59
* `BROWN_1`- indexes 70-79
* `CC2` - indexes 80-87 - company colour 2 (the green one)
* `DARK_GREEN` - indexes 88-95
* `PALE_GREEN` - indexes 96-103
* `BROWN_2` - indexes 104-111
* `BROWN_3` - indexes 112-121
* `BROWN_4` - indexes 122-127
* `MAUVE` - indexes 128-135
* `PURPLE` - indexes 136-143
* `BLUE` - indexes 144-153
* `LIGHT_BLUE` - indexes 154-161
* `PINK` - indexes 162-169
* `LIGHT_PURPLE` - indexes 170-177
* `RED_1` - indexes 178-184 - split red ranges since the differences are quite big from red to yellow
* `RED_2` - indexes 185-191 - split red ranges since the differences are quite big from red to yellow
* `ORANGE` - indexes 192-197
* `CC1` - indexes 198-205 - company colour 1 (the blue one)
* `GREEN` - indexes 206-209
* `CYAN` - indexes 210-214
* `ALPHA_PINK` - index 215 - I don't see any reason to add other pure pink indexes, the converter would use just one anyway
* `COLA` - indexes 227-231 action colours of cola (oil refinery in TTD graphics)
* `FIRE` - indexes 232-238 action colours of fire (fizzy drink factory in TTD graphics)
* `LED_RED` - indexes 239-240 - action colours of red blinking light (from transmitters in TTD graphics)
* `LED_YELLOW` - indexes 241-244 - action colours of yellow blinking light (from lighthouses in TTD graphics)
* `WATER` - indexes 245-254 - action colours of water (water tiles in  TTD graphics)
* `WHITE` - index 255 - pure white is usually useless and will give you errors when compiling from NML
